title: Hello World
---

<p>Welcome around, my name is Ben Kalsky and I live in Tel Aviv, was born in Eilat though, and spend few years of my life at Jerusalem while studying in Boyer. I performed as photographer in the IDF for 3 years.</p>

<p>I Love tech, and I love design! but my real passion is experience! I'm a scientist (not a ruler), I like measurements better then assumptions, I prefer abstract then materials, experiences are totally abstract! Lets test it together :)</p>
